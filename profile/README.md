# What we want to build

tUWitter is a web application categorized as application software in an established area that enables UW students across campus to engage with each other anonymously. The information relevant to campus life received by a UW student consists of emails from UW offices (for example, Student Success Office and Writing Center) and social media from student organizations (for example, GSA and WUSA). Institutions rather than individuals generate such information. Individual voices are lacking in this community than institutional content. With more personal voices, building and changing the community is easier.  

The main obstacle to having more voices heard is peer pressure: young people tend to hide their ideas in exchange for acceptance from the group.

We want to help UW students to share their opinions with the community. We believe anonymity can solve the peer pressure problem. We want to build an anonymous web application that resembles Twitter ---- tUWitter. There is a single timeline of anonymous posts for the entire UW community. Compared to other social platforms for the general user group, such as Instagram, this web application gathers UW information in one place and thus saves students' time. Compared to Reddit, Which also provides anonymity, this web application provides a better mobile user experience. 

The final web app should provide a safe space for UW students to speak out. It will not tolerate hate speech and violent content.
